        <h3>Genetics</h3>
        <p style="width: 80%;">Advances in genetic testing and more widespread use of array CGH (Comparative Genomic
            Hybridization) has led to increased diagnosis of MECP2 duplication syndrome. Array CGH allows for
            sub-microscopic detection of missing or additional copies of genetic material and is the best screening test
            for a child with developmental delay, it is the current way MECP2 is detected in children.</p>

        <h3>Testing & Diagnosis</h3>
        <p style="width: 80%;">The genetic abnormality that causes MECP2 duplication syndrome is a double dose or
            duplication of the MECP2
            gene. Mutations in the MECP2 gene are most commonly associated with RETT Syndrome in females. MECP2, plays a
            pivotal role in regulating brain function. Too little or too much of the MECP2 protein results in brain
            dysfunction and physical impairment.</p>
